### Session Flow & Energy Management

#### Opening Energy (1:00-1:15 PM)
**Objective:** Create urgency and excitement about AI disruption

**Script:**
"Welcome back from lunch! I hope you're energized because this afternoon we're diving into the most exciting and perhaps unsettling part of our journey—how AI is disrupting every industry and creating unprecedented opportunities.

Before we start, stand up and find someone you haven't talked to yet. You have 2 minutes to share: What's one thing from this morning that surprised you? Go!"

*[Play upbeat music during networking]*

"Great energy! Now, as you walk back to your seats, I want you to notice the posters around the room. Each represents a real disruption happening RIGHT NOW. We'll explore these in a moment, but first, let me share why this matters to each of you..."

**The Hook:**
"By the end of today, 3 things will be true:
1. You'll identify at least 3 AI opportunities in your industry
2. You'll have a concrete strategy to AI-proof your career and organization
3. You'll leave with specific actions and an accountability partner

But first, let me show you what's already happening..."
