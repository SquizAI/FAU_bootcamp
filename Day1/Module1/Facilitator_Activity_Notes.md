## Activity Flow & Timing

### 9:00-9:15 | Icebreaker Modification for Executives
Instead of traditional introductions:
- "Share your biggest time waster at work"
- "What would you automate if you could?"
- Creates immediate relevance

**Facilitator Tip**: Write responses on board - reference throughout day

---

### 9:15-9:30 | AI Speed Dating Setup

#### Station Management:
- 5 stations, 3 minutes each
- Use timer with audio cue
- Facilitator at each station for first round
- Peer helpers for rounds 2-3

#### Common Issues & Solutions:
1. **"I don't know what to input"**
   - Have pre-written scenarios as backup
   - Use their icebreaker response

2. **"The output isn't good"**
   - Show how to iterate
   - "What specifically would make it better?"

3. **"This seems too simple"**
   - "Start simple, complexity comes"
   - Show advanced example

#### Energy Management:
- Music during rotations
- Celebrate first outputs loudly
- "Who got something useful?" after each station

---

### 9:30-10:15 | Executive AI Toolkit Build

#### Facilitation Strategy:
1. **Demo First** (5 min)
   - Show YOUR real email transformed
   - Display before/after dramatically
   - "This saved me 20 minutes yesterday"

2. **Guided Practice** (10 min)
   - Everyone does same prompt together
   - Share screens of best outputs
   - Troubleshoot as group

3. **Independent Practice** (25 min)
   - Circulate constantly
   - Look for success stories
   - Address frustrations quickly

#### Differentiation by Role:
- **Marketing**: Focus on content generation
- **Operations**: Focus on process documentation
- **Investment**: Focus on analysis frameworks
- **Mixed Groups**: Pair complementary skills

#### Success Indicators to Watch For:
- Participant says "Oh wow!"
- Someone takes a photo of their screen
- Typing speeds up (confidence growing)
- Asking "Can it also...?" questions

---

### 10:15-10:30 | Strategic Break Activities

#### Not Really a Break:
- "Find someone from different function"
- "Share your best output so far"
- "Steal one prompt from them"
- Facilitator captures best examples

---

### 10:30-11:15 | Real Work Sprint

#### Launch Protocol:
1. **Challenge Selection** (5 min)
   - "Pick your biggest pain point"
   - If stuck: "What did you complain about last week?"
   
2. **Structure Support** (5 min)
   - Provide templates on cards
   - Show example of completed challenge
   
3. **Sprint Time** (30 min)
   - 10-minute warnings
   - Circulate with encouragement
   - Document quick wins

4. **Share Sessions** (5 min)
   - Volunteer basis only
   - Focus on business impact
   - "Who saved the most time?"

#### Handling Resistance:
- **"This won't work for my industry"**
  - Show industry-specific example
  - Pair with someone similar
  
- **"My work is too complex"**
  - Start with one small component
  - Build complexity gradually
  
- **"I don't trust the output"**
  - "It's a draft, not final"
  - Show verification process

---

### 11:15-11:45 | AI Collaboration Patterns

#### Teaching CLARIFY:
- One letter at a time
- Real example for each
- Practice together before independent work

#### Advanced Participants:
- Give them "Challenge Cards":
  - "Make AI disagree with itself"
  - "Get AI to ask YOU questions"
  - "Create a prompt that builds on itself"

#### Struggling Participants:
- Pair with advanced peer
- Provide completed examples
- Focus on one pattern only

---

### 11:45-12:00 | Integration & Commitment

#### Monday Morning Workflow:
1. **Visualization** (3 min)
   - "Close your eyes, it's Monday..."
   - Walk through their morning
   - "Where could AI help?"

2. **Design Time** (7 min)
   - Use provided template
   - Focus on first 2 hours only
   - Make it specific to their role

3. **Commitment Ceremony** (5 min)
   - Write ONE thing they'll do tomorrow
   - Share with accountability partner
   - Take photo of commitment

## Energy Management Throughout

### High Energy Moments:
- First successful output
- Speed dating rotations
- Real work sprint launch
- Success story sharing

### Low Energy Responses:
- Stand-up prompt crafting
- Partner challenges
- "Quick Win" celebrations
- Movement between activities

---

## Common Technical Issues

### Login Problems:
- Have generic accounts ready
- Use phone as backup
- Partner sharing as last resort

### Slow Internet:
- Pre-download examples
- Use phone hotspots
- Work in smaller groups

### Tool Limitations:
- Free tier hits limit: Switch tools

- Site blocked: Use phone browser

---

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Users:
- "Meta" challenges (prompts about prompts)
- Multi-tool workflows
- Teaching others bonus points
- Create prompt library for team

- Start with fill-in-blank templates
- Pair with confident peer
- Celebrate every small win
- Focus on one tool only

- Strategy discussion
- Success story sharing

### If Group Is Too Advanced:
- Jump to integration patterns
- Focus on optimization
- Peer teaching opportunities
- Advanced challenges

### If Group Is Struggling:
- Slow down toolkit build

## Key Messages to Reinforce

Throughout the module, regularly remind:
1. "Progress over perfection"
2. "Start where you are"
3. "AI is your intern, not your boss"
4. "Every prompt gets better"
5. "Real work, real value, right now"

- End with energy

**Your Closing Line**: 
"You just created [total] real work outputs in 3 hours. Imagine what's possible in 3 months."
