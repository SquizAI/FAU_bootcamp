## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Team Dynamics Challenges
**Problem**: One person dominating discussions
**Solution**: Implement "round-robin" sharing where each person speaks before anyone speaks twice

**Problem**: Analysis paralysis or perfectionism
**Solution**: Set micro-deadlines and use "good enough to move forward" decision criteria

**Problem**: Technical difficulties with AI tools
**Solution**: Pair team members, use backup accounts, have offline alternatives ready

### Business Development Blocks
**Problem**: Can't find a unique market opportunity
**Solution**: Focus on underserved customer segments or unique AI application angles

**Problem**: Prototype seems too complex to build
**Solution**: Break down to minimum viable product (MVP) and use AI for rapid mockup creation

**Problem**: Market size appears too small
**Solution**: Expand addressable market definition or identify multiple customer segments
