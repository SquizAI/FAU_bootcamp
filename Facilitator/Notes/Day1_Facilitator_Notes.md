#### Station-Specific Facilitation Notes

**ChatGPT Station**:
- *Demo Prompt*: "Rewrite this email to be more professional and concise: [insert casual email]"
- *Common Issue*: Generic responses → Show how to add context
- *Advanced Challenge*: "Make it persuasive for a skeptical audience"
- *Success Indicator*: Participant says "That's much better than I would have written"

**Claude Station**:
- *Demo Prompt*: "Analyze this business challenge and provide 3 strategic options: [insert scenario]"
- *Common Issue*: Vague outputs → Teach specific context setting
- *Advanced Challenge*: "Ask Claude to challenge your assumptions"
- *Success Indicator*: Participant gets genuinely useful analysis

**Copilot Station**:
- *Demo Prompt*: "Help me structure this document for executive presentation"
- *Common Issue*: Not integrated with their actual documents
- *Workaround*: Use generic document example, then show integration
- *Success Indicator*: Recognition of how it fits their workflow

**Gemini Station**:
- *Demo Prompt*: "Research current trends in [their industry] and summarize key implications"
- *Common Issue*: Information overload → Show filtering techniques
- *Advanced Challenge*: "Compare sources and identify potential biases"

### Executive AI Toolkit Build (9:30-10:15) - Deep Dive into Value

#### Teaching Strategy: Demo → Guided → Independent

**Demo Phase (9:30-9:35)**:
- Use YOUR real work example
- Show before/after dramatically
- Emphasize time saved: "This saved me 20 minutes yesterday"
- Make it personally relevant to their icebreaker responses

**Demo Example Script**:
*"I'm going to show you my actual email from yesterday. Here's what I wrote first [show draft]. Here's what ChatGPT helped me create [show result]. Five minutes of work, saved me 15 minutes of revision, and the recipient said it was the clearest proposal they'd ever received."*

**Guided Practice Phase (9:35-9:45)**:
- Everyone does same prompt together
- Use overhead projector to show different outputs
- Troubleshoot as group: "What made Sarah's output better?"
- Build confidence: "See how each one is useful in different ways?"

**Independent Practice Phase (9:45-10:15)**:
- Circulate constantly - maximum 2 minutes per table
- Look for breakthrough moments and amplify them
- Address frustrations quickly and privately
- Document success stories for sharing

#### Differentiation by Experience Level

**For Beginners** (Based on pre-assessment):
- Provide fill-in-the-blank prompt templates
- Start with email/content tasks (familiar territory)
- Pair with confident participant
- Celebrate every small success
- Focus on one tool only

**For Intermediate Users**:
- Show iteration techniques
- Introduce chaining prompts
- Challenge with more complex scenarios
- Use as peer teachers for beginners

**For Advanced Users**:
- Meta-prompting challenges
- Multi-tool workflows
- "Break the AI" exercises
- Leadership coaching opportunities

#### Success Indicators to Watch For
- Typing speed increases (confidence growing)

- Taking photos of screens
- Spontaneous "wow" reactions
- Showing outputs to neighbors

---

### Strategic Break (10:15-10:30) - Maintain Momentum

#### Not a Real Break - Structured Networking
**Activity**: "Find someone from a different function"
- Share your best output so far
- Steal one prompt from them
- Return to your table with new idea

**Facilitator Actions**:
- Circulate and listen for best examples
- Note success stories for sharing
- Identify participants who need extra support
- Take photos of great outputs (with permission)

### Real Work Sprint (10:30-11:15) - Make It Personal

#### Launch Protocol (10:30-10:35)

**Challenge Selection Strategy**:
- "Pick your biggest pain point from this morning's list"
- If stuck: "What did you complain about to your team last week?"
- Provide specific templates for common challenges
- Show completed example first

**Support Structure Setup**:
- Place challenge templates on each table
- Assign peer buddies for accountability
- Set expectations: "Rough draft is perfect"
- Emphasize: "This is YOUR work, not fake examples"

#### Sprint Management (10:35-11:10)

**Timing Warnings**:
- 25 minutes remaining: "Get started now"
- 15 minutes remaining: "Focus on one specific output"
- 10 minutes remaining: "Finish what you have"
- 5 minutes remaining: "Prepare your success story"

**Facilitation During Sprint**:
- Visit each table twice minimum
- Provide encouragement, not solutions
- Document time savings: "How long would this normally take you?"
- Note implementation commitments
- Address resistance immediately

#### Common Resistance Patterns and Responses

**"This won't work for my industry"**:
- Response: "Let's try one specific example right now"
- Action: Find industry-specific example or pair with similar participant
- Follow-up: "What would need to change to make it work?"

**"My work is too complex for AI"**:
- Response: "Start with one small component"
- Action: Break down their challenge into pieces
- Demonstrate: "AI doesn't replace your expertise, it accelerates it"

**"I don't trust the output quality"**:
- Response: "It's a first draft, not the final product"
- Action: Show verification and editing process
- Emphasize: "You're still the expert - AI is your research assistant"

**"This seems too easy/simple"**:
- Response: "Simple tools create complex value"
- Action: Show advanced example of same technique
- Challenge: "What could you do with 2 hours of saved time per week?"

#### Share Session (11:10-11:15)

**Voluntary Sharing Only**:
- "Who got something they're excited about?"
- Focus on business impact, not technical features
- Ask audience: "Who could use something similar?"
- End with: "Who saved the most time estimate?"
