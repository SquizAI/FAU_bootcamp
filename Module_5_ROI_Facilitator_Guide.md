### Facilitation Steps

#### Step 1: Role-Based Grouping (2 minutes)
- Have participants self-identify their role level
- Group similar roles together for peer discussion
- Provide role-specific benchmark ranges

**Talking Points:**
- "Executives focus on enterprise-wide impact"
- "Managers calculate team productivity multipliers"
- "Individual contributors quantify personal output gains"

#### Step 2: Baseline Data Collection (3 minutes)

**Guide participants to:**
1. Enter current salary (assure confidentiality)
2. Estimate weekly time on repetitive tasks
3. Identify their biggest time wasters

**Common Questions & Answers:**
- Q: "What if I don't know exact hours?"
- A: "Use rough estimates—even 20% accuracy gives valuable insights"

- Q: "Should I include my bonus?"
- A: "Use base salary for conservative estimates"

#### Step 3: Time Savings Calculation (5 minutes)

**Walk through example:**
"If you spend 10 hours/week on reports and AI reduces this by 60%, that's 6 hours/week or 300 hours/year. At $100/hour, that's $30,000 in time value."

**Tips for accuracy:**
- Use conservative reduction percentages
- Focus on truly automatable tasks
- Include learning curve time

#### Step 4: Productivity/Revenue Impact (5 minutes)

**Role-Specific Guidance:**

**For Executives:**
- "Think about faster strategic decisions"
- "Consider new AI-enabled revenue streams"
- "Factor in competitive advantage"

**For Managers:**
- "Calculate team productivity lift"
- "Include project acceleration value"
- "Consider quality improvements"

**For Individual Contributors:**
- "Focus on output multiplication"
- "Include error reduction value"
- "Factor in innovation time"

#### Step 5: Career Value Discussion (3 minutes)

**Facilitate peer sharing:**
- "Share with your neighbor: What's the salary difference between your role and someone with AI expertise?"
- "What new opportunities would AI skills open?"

**Provide market data:**
- AI skill premium: 15-40% salary increase
- 78% of AI-skilled professionals promoted within 2 years
- 65% receive multiple job offers annually

#### Step 6: ROI Calculation & Reality Check (2 minutes)

**Quick validation:**
- If ROI < 100%: "What value are we missing?"
- If ROI > 500%: "Let's make this more conservative"
- Sweet spot: 150-300% first-year ROI
