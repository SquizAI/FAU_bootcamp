## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Sequential Patterns
1. **Assessment → Customization → Delivery**
   - Knowledge Assessment → Learning Path Generator → Progress Tracker

2. **Lead → Score → Convert → Track**
   - AI Adoption Scraper → Lead Scoring → Campaign Orchestrator → Outcome Tracker

3. **Story → Proof → Promote**
   - Transformation Storyteller → Social Proof Harvester → Content Generator

### Parallel Patterns
- Multiple agents can work simultaneously:
  - Progress Tracker + AI Sentiment Analyzer (during modules)
  - Lead Scoring + Campaign Orchestrator (recruitment)
  - Outcome Tracker + Market Gap Finder (post-program)

## Best Practices

### Data Management
- Maintain participant privacy while tracking outcomes
- Share insights across agents for comprehensive view
- Regular data hygiene and update cycles

### Quality Control
- Human review of agent-generated content
- Participant consent for success story usage
- Regular calibration of scoring algorithms

### Continuous Improvement
- Monthly review of agent effectiveness
- Participant feedback on personalization
- Industry benchmark comparisons

## Technical Requirements

2. **Data Gaps**: Insufficient information for agent operation
   - Solution: Implement progressive data collection strategies

3. **Over-Automation**: Loss of personal touch
   - Solution: Balance agent efficiency with human interaction

### Escalation Path
1. Agent anomaly detected → Review by program coordinator
2. Participant dissatisfaction → Direct facilitator intervention
3. System-wide issues → Technical team engagement
